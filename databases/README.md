**Repository for Spectral Line databases for use with NEMESIS**

This database was compiled in 2018 based on Cassini/CIRS spectral line sources.
The "112" format is a HITRAN2000 100-character format with an extra 12 spaces to
deal with ammonia inversion line cross-coupling.  The "120" format is a GEISA
style that does not include this coupling.

This database should not be used for spectra less than 4 microns, as ammonia and
phosphine lines were found to be incomplete.

Sources of spectral line data are described in Table 2 of Fletcher et al. 2018 (
https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00572).
